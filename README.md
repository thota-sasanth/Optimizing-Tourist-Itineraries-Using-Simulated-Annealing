# Optimizing-Tourist-Itineraries-Using-Simulated-Annealing
In this project, I have used a stochastic optimization algorithm called Simulated Annealing to optimize tourist itineraries. I have used Python & Folium to generate resulting plots. 

## Problem Statement & Background

For a given set of tourist attractions, I plan to provide a quick and optimal travel itinerary based on user preferences. <br>
<br>
In an age where tourism is not just a leisure activity but a pursuit of cultural and personal
enrichment, the complexity of planning the perfect travel itinerary remains a universal
concern for travelers worldwide. Tourists often grapple with the complexities of optimizing their travel plans, attempting to strike a
delicate balance between maximizing exploration and minimizing logistical hurdles. This project aims to introduce an effective solution and serve as a valuable tool for tourists exploring
a new country or anyone seeking assistance in crafting personalized and efficient travel itineraries.

On a high level, this problem is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We know
that TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning that as the number of cities increases, the number of
possible solutions grows exponentially, making it computationally infeasible to solve for large
instances using brute-force or dynamic programming algorithms such as the Held-Karp algorithm. For
instance, to find an optimal solution using brute force for N places there are (N - 1)! / 2 possible routes. Letâ€™s say, if we want to compute for 20 places, there are ***60,822,550,204,080,000*** different possible routes. 

## Simulated Annealing

In such large search spaces, simulated annealing (a heuristic-based optimization algorithm) could be very
useful in finding a reasonably good solution within a limited time. This algorithm is inspired by the metallurgical practice of
annealing, where metals are heated to a high temperature and then gradually cooled. This controlled
process allows metal atoms to rearrange themselves into a more stable crystalline structure, thus
reducing defects and achieving a lower-energy state. Similarly, simulated annealing in optimization
allows for a deliberate and probabilistic exploration of the solution space, which helps in finding a
globally optimal solution by avoiding being trapped in local optima.

The algorithm starts at a high temperature with a random initial solution and gradually finds an optimal solution after cooling down based on a neighborhood exploration strategy. The model flow chart looks like -

## Data 
I have curated a dataset of the Top 50 real-world tourist attractions, with precise
geographical coordinates and additional descriptions obtained from [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/country/united-states-236.html) <br>


## Dashboard Implementation & Components
I implemented the dashboard as in a client-server architecture. The dashboard consist of advanced charts - 

* Zoomable Choropleth Map
* Accident Severity Slider
* Parallel Coordinates Plot
* TreeMap
* Stacked Bar Chart
* Time Series Area Chart
* Radial Bar Plot

Every chart is linked with every other chart with wide range of **interactions**, **overlays**, **pop-ups**, and **brushings**. This way the user can easily get a deeper level of details and gain better insights.
<br>

## Findings
As the dataset taken is very large, there are a lot of insights that can be gathered after playing around with the dashboard. Some of the major findings I came across using the intearctions and dashboard are - 

* **Population has a high impact on accident rate**
* **Weekdays have most number of accidents compared against weekends**
* **8AM and 5PM are the peak times for accidents within a day**
* **Juntion, Traffic Signal, and Crossings are the top 3 accidents prone POI (point of interest) areas**
* **High humidity in the early mornings leads to more number of accidents**
* **Counties with most accidents have higher office job population compared to service job population**

You can gather a lot more insights leveraging this custom-designed visual analytics dashboard.
